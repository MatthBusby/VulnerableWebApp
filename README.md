# VulnerableWebApp
Written by Michael Braun

This is a deliberately Vulnerable Web Application that runs on Django. It is designed (intentionally and unintentionally) to be terrible. The purpose of this application is to be used as part of my [VulnerableAzure](https://github.com/metalstormbass/VulnerableAzure) project.

<b> DO NOT DEPLOY THIS IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS. </b>

Added ShiftLeft Integration
